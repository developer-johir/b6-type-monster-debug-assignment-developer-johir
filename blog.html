                <h4><span class="text-primary">Question-1:</span> What is the difference between LocalStorage and SessionStorage?</h4>
                <p><span class="text-danger fw-bold">Answer:-</span> Session storage is similar to local storage; The difference is that while data in local storage does not expire, data in session storage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session is created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

                <h4><span class="text-primary">Question-2:</span> What is the difference between global scope and block scope?</h4>
                <p><span class="text-danger fw-bold">Answer:-</span> In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for statements, and the like.</p>

                <h4><span class="text-primary">Question-3:</span> How does the event loop work in JavaScript?</h4>
                <p><span class="text-danger fw-bold">Answer:-</span> JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java. <br> The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                <h4><span class="text-primary">Question-4:</span> Why is undefined found in Javascript?</h4>
                <p><span class="text-danger fw-bold">Answer:-</span> A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
